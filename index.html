				<p class="story">Born in Egypt, I know I've said it maybe too many times. I miss living there, t'sall!
				Seriously, Egypt though, nice beaches and great tasting mangos!<br><br>
				Lived in Alexandria, Cairo, Abu Dhabi, New York, and now Orlando. I wonder where I'll end up next. I love New York, but I also hate it ! Taxi drivers in New York behave very much like the ones in Egypt, maybe it's because a lot of the drivers in New York are Egyptian. I was one of them not 2 years ago. I love to cook and love working with my hands. If its not hands on I will probably lose interest. I learn by trial and error, and I've erred more times than I care to remember.<br><br>

				I hope to eventually retire by a coastal city. If or when that happens, ideally, I would have paid my dues to my family and my community both in the US and in Egypt.</p>
